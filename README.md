# Android With Java Course Project

This repository contains the project I completed as part of my Android development course using Java. It serves as a practical demonstration of various Android components, APIs, and development concepts.

## About This Project

This application is a collection of several mini-apps, each designed to explore a specific feature of the Android framework. It showcases my ability to build a multi-activity application and integrate different functionalities into a single, cohesive user experience.

## Features Implemented

This project includes the following features and mini-apps:

*   **🧮 Calculator:** A simple, functional calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
*   **🏔️ Random Mountain:** A fun app that displays a random high mountain, demonstrating the use of arrays and random number generation.
*   **🍔 Restaurant Menu:** A simple UI to display a restaurant menu.
*   **❓ Quiz App:** A "Dog or Cat" quiz that showcases handling user choices and displaying results.
*   **🌐 Web View:** An activity that loads and displays a live website using Android's `WebView`.
